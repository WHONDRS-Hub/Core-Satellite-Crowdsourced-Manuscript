# ReadMe for the metabolome data files

'Processed_S19S_Sed-Water_08.12_Data.csv' and 'Processed_S19S_Sed-Water_08.12_Mol.csv' are files
obtained by using the R package ftmsRanalysis (https://github.com/EMSL-Computing/ftmsRanalysis)
and are the processed versions of the raw FTICR-MS report. These files have been processed
to include non-isotopic metabolites with a mass between 200-900 m/z. These files were
compressed to save space and will need to be unzipped before use.

'S19S_Metadata.csv' contains meta-data information (i.e., latitude, longitude, site, etc.)
